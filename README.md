# RockPaperScissors

This is a Rock/Paper/Scissors game.
I created this game using HTML,CSS,Javascript
It have a great ui, and it's also responsive ( You can play it on the phone )
It takes me 3 days to finish it, from structuring to algorithm ( programming ) and ending it with a great responsive styling.
